# Predicting-El-Salvador-House-Prices
Used Scrapy to scrape and clean data from an online listings website to predict house prices in El Salvador. Scrapy, Python (2019)

At the company I previously worked for, PM Inversiones, this project inspired the gathering of property data from various sources in an efficient manner and storing them in a database. For the first time, the company started retreiving and storing property information. We are all very excited for this, as it will allow for long term analysis of property price trends in El Salvador. I am confident that this more rigorous analysis of property data will give a competittive advantage to the investment firm.

# Predicting-El-Salvador-House-Prices
Used Scrapy to scrape and clean data from an online listings website to predict house prices in El Salvador. Scrapy, Python (2019)

At the company I previously worked for, PM Inversiones, this project started a trend to gather and store property data from various sources for analysis. For the first time, the company started retreiving and storing property information for statistical analysis. We are all very excited for this, as it will allow for long term analysis of property price trends in El Salvador.
